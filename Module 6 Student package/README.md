 ### Common questions:

 * My school does not provide student emails or IDs. What can I submit to prove that I’m a student?

 GitHub will consider any documentation you provide. If they cannot accept your uploaded proof on your first attempt, you will receive an email asking you to submit supplementary information.

 * My application wasn’t accepted. What should I do?

 You may need to provide additional documentation before they can approve your application. A common problem is that the uploaded proof was undated, or the photo was too blurry. Regardless of the reason, they will try to provide context so that your next application has a greater chance of success.
