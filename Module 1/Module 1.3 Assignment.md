# Module 1.3 Assignment

Now that you have learned more about Git, on the command line I would like you to do the following:

- [ ] Create a file called `dsc_kabarak.txt` in the directory you created in Module 1.2
- [ ] Write "Hello DSC Kabarak Members!" in `dsc_kabarak.txt` and **commit** your changes
- [ ] Now write "Hola DSC Kabarak!" in `dsc_kabarak.txt`
- [ ] Show the differences between your _Working Directory_ and _Staging Area_
- [ ] Add `dsc_kabarak.txt` to your _Staging Area_
- [ ] Show the differences between your _Staging Area_ and your _Repository_
- [ ] Commit dsc_kabarak.txt to your repository (Local Repository)

Once you have completed these steps, take a screenshot of your command line, with the steps above, 
and upload your screenshot to a new Issue titled Module 1.3 Assignment.
